# Fast Break College Basketball mods


This report is a bunch of mods for [Fast Break College Basketball](http://greydogsoftware.com/fast-break-college-basketball). released in 2010 by Grey Dog Software and designed by Brian Nichols.

Over the years of playing this game, I've created lots of different mods, mostly updated college alignments and lately a lot of pro name files because it's easier to do than ever. 

Lots of league structures that are not realistic and my way of getting around creating logos for all of the teams in foreign leagues where I don't want to deal with logo tedium is generating one logo for the entire league and using it for all the teams because it doesn't matter to me that much. 

All in all, keeping finances leveled across the game will work and if you run into errors on the last day of FA before going into training camp, make sure you save on Day 30 and then turn off finances briefly and it should let you advance. It'll mean guys will sign just anywhere, but it's better than losing your whole league.
